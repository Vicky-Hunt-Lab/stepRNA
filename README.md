# stepRNA

## Overview

stepRNA is a RNA-seq read processor, based on bowtie2, that will align small RNA-seq query reads (passenger sequences) to reference sequences (siRNAs) and output information about the type and length of overhangs uncovered. It was originally developed for uncovering Dicer processing signatures but is not limited to just this.

## Installation

In order for stepRNA to run you must have:
- Bowtie2 >= v2.3.4 (see [BOWTIE2 website](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) for more details)
- Bio >= v0.3.0 (automatically installed with pip)
- numpy >= v1.20.1 (autoamtically installed with pip)
- pysam >= v0.16.0.1 (autoamtically installed with pip)

**To install with pip:**

```pip3 install stepRNA```

**To install from source:**

1) Download stepRNA-X.X.X.tar.gz from PyPI_URL:
2) Unzip it:

```tar -xvzf stepRNA-X.X.X.tar.gz```

3) Move into stepRNA-X.X.X repository:

```cd stepRNA-X.X.X```

4) Run the installation:

```pip3 install .```


**Alternative:**

Download the GitHub repository then make the script executable with:
```chmod +x bin/stepRNA```

Then either:
- Make a symbolic link for stepRNA.py to your bin directory
```ln FULL_PATH_TO_stepRNA.py FULL_PATH_TO_BIN```
- Direct PATH to the directory with stepRNA in it
```export PATH=$PATH:FULL_PATH_TO_GitHubRepo```

## Use:

See the documentation for a detailed description on how to use stepRNA ([MANUAL](URL_LINK))

The quickest way to use stepRNA:

```stepRNA --reference REFERENCE --reads QUERY```
 
This will align the reads to the reference sequences and output into the current diretory using the READS filename as the prefix. **REFERENCE** and **QUERY** must have unique FASTA headers (if not use ```-u```)

Helpful options:
- ```--name``` can be used to customise the prefix name
- ```--directory``` can be used to specify an output directory

## Example:

Using the reads from stepRNA/example_data:

```stepRNA --reference stepRNA/example_data/FILENAME -- reads stepRNA/example_data/FILENAME --directory stepRNA_example```

This will create a new direxotry called *stepRNA_example* that contains:
- AligmentFile/; a directory containing BAM files for each of the overhang lengths
- CSVs; containing count information (see [MANUAL](URL_LINK) for more information)
